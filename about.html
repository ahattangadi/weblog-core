<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  Hey, Iâ€™m Aarav, a <span id="age"></span> year old student from Mumbai, India
  who has an interest in programming, and all things related to technology. I
  also like to <a href="https://youtube.com/@ThePianoKid">play the piano</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I like to spend my time building projects that interest me, as well as pushing
  myself to learn more and share my knowledge with others.
</p>
<p>
  I have the most experience with C# and JavaScript, but I&#39;m always
  exploring new languages.
