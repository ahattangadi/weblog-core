Hey, Iâ€™m Aarav, a 13 year old student from Mumbai, India who has an interest in programming, and all things related to technology. I also like to [play the piano](https://youtube.com/@ThePianoKid).

I like to spend my time building projects that interest me, as well as pushing myself to learn more and share my knowledge with others.

I have the most experience with C# and JavaScript, but I'm always exploring new languages.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/ahattangadi), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/a_hattangadi), and [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@ahattangadi). If you want to email me, go ahead and send an email to <a href="mailto:aarav@hattangadi.com?subject=From your blog">aarav@hattangadi.com</a>
